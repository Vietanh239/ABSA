In this scientific article, we build an application related to the evaluation of customer comments on the restaurant's side. For this purpose, the team uses a dataset established by the team with a consensus of 85\%. This dataset is collected on reputable food review websites so that it can create an objective and precise dataset as possible. After acquiring the dataset, the team used PySpark primarily with key support libraries such as BigDL and Analytics zoo. The result is to create an application with many different models to achieve the most general results, but the highest accuracy is 0.71 with the RNN and CountVectorizer models.
